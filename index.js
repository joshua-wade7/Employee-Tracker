const inquirer = require("inquirer");

// construct inquirer prompt - What should this look like / how many do I want?  Just 1 and switch statement? Or multiple prompts and no switch statement?

// functions required to make the CLI app run.

//contstruct db queries ? What all needs to be queried and what functions should they be placed in?

// final function 'function init()' most likely, to restart the prompt when the user selects "Restart(?)" and exits out of the CLI app when the user selects "Quit".
